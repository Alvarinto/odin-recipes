    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="desc">
      Cachopo, a really tasty Asturian dish, made of beef, ham and cheesee, the
      <em>MAGIC</em> mix. "Don Cachopo" is one of the most common dishes there
      in Asturias, along with the best fabada asturiana or the loved rice with
      milk as the crowned dessert. If you ever been there, you know that size
      matters, who is the crazy person who dislikes a giant cachopo?

   <div class="steps">
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <p>
       Go running, make some exercise, walk for 78 hours straight, but make sure
       that you are hungry or you wont finish the dish! Let's cook
     </p>
    
     <ol>
       <li>
         Prepare the flour, the bread crumbs and the 2 eggs mixed in separated
         plates
       </li>
       <li>
         We're gonna smash the meat, yes you read well, grab any contundent
         object you have in the kitchen and smash the beef steaks
       </li>
       <li>Once smashed, extend it and then add salt as you like</li>
       <li>Put the ham and the cheesse in top of the extended steak</li>
       <li>
         You can add an open fried piquillo pepper if you want to( i recommend
         it)
       </li>
       <li>Add as many layers of ham and cheesse as you want</li>
       <li>
         Take the other smashed steak and close the "Sandwich" you just made
       </li>
       <li>
         coat the steak in flour, then egg and last, the bread crumps, you can do
         this process 1 or 2 times for a thicker batter( i don't recommend it)
       </li>
   
      <li>
        Once you have all the cachopos you want ready, start heating som oil in
        the pan for frying, mid fire, so the oil isn't too hot
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook around 3 minutes for each side, searching a golden colour, so
        everything is cooked inside
      </li>
      <li>
        Put some paper in top of a plate, so when you retire the cachopos, it
        will absorb the excess of oil
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait until the're a little bit colder!!! You're gonna burn your thonge
      </li>
      <li>Ready, you have your cachopos!</li>
    </ol>
