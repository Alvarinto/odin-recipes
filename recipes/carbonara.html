        We all know italians make good food, pizzas, pasta... yeah good stuff. One
        of my favourites is <em>Carbonara</em>, a tasty mix of egg, pasta, pepper,
        cheesee and bacon. The truth is that the original recipe doesn't use
        bacon, italians did use the cheek of the pig, what they call the
        <em>"guanciale"</em>.

        Today we'll learn how to make this delicious food in a few steps, and a
        really short amount of time. Do you need to stay coding for 12 hours but
        you need to eat something? Make some <strong>CARBONARA</strong> and
        everything will be better in your life (and your code)
    </p>

    <!-- add a bg for the container of ingredients and steps, make some differences between them, but not much
            same for the 3 recipes, try to add same clases for not repeating code
        -->

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have everything to start and a masive feeling of starving,
            let's cook!
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Start boiling some water, once is boiling you can add some salt and oil,
                then the pasta, or just the pasta
            </li>
            <li>
                While the pasta is boiling, cut in small rectangles the bacon or the
                guanciale
            </li>
            <li>
                Put a pan in the fire, if you're using bacon add some oil, just a little
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're using guanciale put it directly into the pan, the same fat of
                the guanciale will do the work of the oil
            </li>
            <li>
                High fire for the meat for around the same time the pasta boils( around
                8 mins depending of the pasta
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you move time to time the meat or it will burn</li>
            <li>
                Once the pasta is done. grab a glass or a cup and save some boiling
                water for later
            </li>
            <li>
                Strain the pasta then cut the boiling of the pasta putting it under cold
                water
            </li>
            <li>Mix the meat and the pasta and move it</li>
            <li>Meanwhile separate the egg white of the yolk</li>
            <li>
                Mix some parmesian with the yolk and stir until you get a homogenius
                mix, add cheesse if you need to
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the egg sauce and the aforementioned water to the pan with the pasta
                and the meat and stir until is mixed
            </li>
            <li>Serve it on a plate and add black pepper</li>
            <li>Done! Enjoy eating!</li>
